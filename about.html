            <h1>Story</h1>
            <p>Set in the plague-ravaged city of Dunwall, Dishonored follows the story of Corvo Attano, the last bodyguard to Empress Jessamine Kaldwin. Framed for her murder and the abduction of her daughter, Emily, Corvo is falsely imprisoned by the Empress' Royal Spymaster and usurper, Hiram Burrows.</p>

            <p>Six months later, on the eve of his execution, Corvo escapes confinement with the help of a shadowy group of loyalists who seek to eliminate those involved in the assassination of the Empress and restore Emily to the throne. He is further assisted by an enigmatic god called the Outsider, who grants him Supernatural Abilities for reasons equally mysterious.</p>
                
            <p>Corvo takes on the role of a feared and infamous assassin as he pursues members of the coup one by one - but whether he is out for justice or revenge is another question. Dishonored features multiple endings, which are dependent on Corvo's actions and player choice throughout the course of the game.</p>

            <h1>Gameplay</h1>
            <p>The focus of Dishonored is on affecting the world and the narrative primarily through Corvo's actions, and how he accomplishes each of his missions. Corvo has an extensive variety of weapons at his disposal, as well as an array of supernatural abilities. Corvo can choose whether to sneak through his environments without being detected, or wreck havoc on his enemies in broad daylight.</p>

            <p>Dishonored runs on what's called a <b>chaos system</b>, which tracks the number of kills and chaos that Corvo has done during missions. If he has committed more crimes and caused more deaths, the game environment reacts accordingly, changing character's dialogue and modifying the levels to make them more difficult.</p>

            <p>Each of the world's environments focuses on verticality, enabling the player to experience the entirety of a level from sewer systems and waterways to rooftops. Players can use Corvo's free-running expertise to scale buildings, slide under obstacles, and sprint across platforms, with certain supernatural abilities further augmenting his movements. Many areas are open to exploration; hidden rewards and experiences await for more adventurous players to find.</p>

            <p>This chaos system continues into the DLC as well as Dishonored 2. Death of the Outsider does not have the chaos system.</p>

            <h1>Missions</h1>
            <p>There are a variety of different missions that take place in the Dishonored world and most of them are centered on assassinating (or otherwise eliminating) a certain target. Detours may be taken along the way to discover secrets and rewards.</p>
